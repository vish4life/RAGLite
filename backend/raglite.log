1. The global economy is heading towards a soft landing with inflation approaching targets, leading monetary authorities to ease cycles.
2. Despite moderation in credit growth and profitability, the financials of the global banking sector remain healthy.
3. Prudent and proactive financial regulation and supervision are essential to maintain financial stability while supporting growth.
4. There are concerns about the resilience of the banking sector due to weaknesses in governance, risk management practices, and regulatory frameworks.
5. The growing role of non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) has added complexity to the financial system, prompting regulators and central banks to strengthen their supervisory frameworks.
